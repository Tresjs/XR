With developement for WebXR often involving alternating between writing code on a development machine and testing the result of that code on a mixed reality headset, instead of the typical web developer workflow of creating and testing websites on one device. This can be jarring and confusing how to debug and resolve common problems.

We have consolidated a list of techniques for simplying XR developement and resolving commmon problems below to help resolve any issues you may come across during development of your WebXR application. üßë‚Äçüîß
